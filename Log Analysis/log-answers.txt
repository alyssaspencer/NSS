1.	What type of log file is it?
2.	What are the dates, which are represented by the logs?
3.	How many unique users appear?
4.	What was the largest data export? And does it look out of the ordinary?
5.	What is the most common error found in the error logs?
6.	Do you see anything, which is out of the ordinary?
7.	Write a short synopsis of what you found in each file.


1: These are access logs from different ip addresses, with a few PHP error logs, one security log and a server messages log. 

2: The dates I found are from November 7th to December 8th.

3:There are hundreds of ip addresses; the most logs are from California, I also saw someone outside of the Nile.  

4: I’m not sure I see the number for data exporting. I see the web browser used and a number before it, if the number is the file size of the download then the largest number I see is 4,036,805. I’m assuming that number is in bytes.


5: Command not found is the most common error in the access, and the error logs seem to have a lot of “script not found or unable to stat”.

6: There was about fifty failed login attempt from China as stated in the secure file.

7. There was a lot of information; from PHP errors to server access logs that where almost innumerable, to secure server logs and messages. If anything I was astounded at the huge list of ip addresses and information a server collects, before now I had no Idea a server gathered so much about you when you download! This will give me extra precautions when managing servers/files in the future.
